# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This was a challenge to refractor provided code for Horiseon's marketing agency website and apply semantic HTML structure, rearrange the structure to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, include alt attributes to the icon and image elements, rearrange the heading attributes in sequential order, and add a concise, descriptive title.

The main goal was to implement web accessibility to the website. This allows the website to be compatible with assistive technologies for people with disabilities. Another goal was to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability by increasing the efficiency. This was done by consolidating selectors and properties of the CSS and debugging the links to ensure they all function properly.
